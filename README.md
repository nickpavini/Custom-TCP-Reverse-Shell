# Custom-TCP-Reverse-Shell
Customized TCP Reverse shell to help myself understand some basic concepts.

&nbsp;

Background
----------

In the pursuit of understanding I wanted to see how people bypass firewall protections with their viruses. On Windows it seems that they block outgoing connections from powershell or cmd, regarding them as malicious.

However, a custom python script can easily bypass windows firewall up to windows 10.

What I learned
--------------

From the attacker standpoint, they need a virus that wont get found if they can get it on the computer, and an easy way to get their virus on the computer.

From the victim standpoint, we need to be careful about links we click, files we open, and probably other things I do not know about yet. These basic principles I learned here seem like the stuff behind ransomware, data theft, mass DDos, and other mal-intent.
